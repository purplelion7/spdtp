### About my project
Project Title: Shortening Physical Distance Through Photography

Creator: Izumi Ando

The main objective of Shortening Physical Distance Through Photography (SPDTP) is to create an art piece to make geographical distance less of a barrier between people all over the world. I believe that overcoming this geographical and mental barrier by recognizing that we all share one Earth is the first step in achieving any kind of change on a global level.

The art project has been designed so that it collectively displays pictures of sunrises taken all over the world on the same day on one globe. The 3D globe model will be uploaded online and the feedback will be used to evaluate its efficacy.

All the photos on the globe were taken on the morning of August 9th, 2018, each at the location of which the photos are attached to on the map.
To collect these photos, I reached out to over 60 people from all over the world, including friends, friends of friends, as well as photographers I had never met before. Nearly 40 were kind enough to say yes, and over 20 were able to photograph the scene.

The code for the 3D globe was originally created by Jeanne Castillo, who shared it as a tutorial on gitconnected (https://levelup.gitconnected.com/tutorial-build-an-interactive-virtual-globe-with-three-js-33cf7c2090cb). I modified the code to fit the purposes of this project with the help of my friend, Tomo Yamamoto.
